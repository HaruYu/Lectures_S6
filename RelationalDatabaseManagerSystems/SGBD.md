## What's a database?

* A very large integrated collection of data.
* A system that manages data of an enterprise

A DBMS is a software that store and manages databases. (Oracle, DB2 (IBM), MySQL...)

Its aim is to reduce developing time of a software.

## File vs DBMS

An application is using a database.
The data have to be consistant and secured, with access control, crash recovery.

## Reasons to use a DBMS

It allows to access the data efficiently and independant.
If one uses a program with specific data, one has to change the whole data set. It is an advantage to use DBMS.
It is secured, it is possible to give rights and access to specific entities...

There is a growing volume and diversity of big data. There are more and more digital usings.
The data is not that structured.

## Data models

There are 3 representations of data.
A representation of a real entity
A data model is a collection concepts for describing data
A schema is a description of a particular collection of data using the data model
The relational model of data is the most widely used model.
* Main concept: A table
* Every relation is a chema which describes the columns or fields

## Level of abstractions

* View point
* Conceptual Schema
* physical

Enterprises are using the last level so it can be changed during the developing.
