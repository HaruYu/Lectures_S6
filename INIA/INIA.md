# Why Machine learning

## Classical programming

It takes rules, data, and gives an output.

## Machine learning

Takes data, answers and gives rules.

**Exemple**: How to labelize a text (attribute). (Politics, sports...)

* Index the words (for exemple 50 words)
* Give it to the machine.

### Supervised learning

0 -> ML -> 1 => Wrong. Have now to calculate the error and change the machinne.

f is a function that catagorizes an imput, a h function is searched to get close
to f.

If f is continuous -> regression
If f is discrete -> classification

### Unsupervised learning

No labels. It is complicated to get datas.

Learning voice: It needs a database. Segmentation of a voice takes time. and

Clustering: Reduce the number of data to get 'categories'

### Reinforcement learning

Used in game playing and robotics.

One have data. And the machine gets a reward.

### Exemple of applications

* Determin sentiments (negative, neutral, positive) : classification
* Group newspaper according to the topic : Classification if label, else clustering
* Identify the broad topic of a newspaper article : Clustering / classification
* Predict monthly rent of an appartment you want to rent out : Reduction
* Predict fuel consumption of a car based on weight and horsepower : Reduction
* Classify an incoming e-mail as spam or not-spam : Classification / clustering
* Find communities of users in a social network on their interests and comments
that they write : Clustering

# Applications of Machine learning

* Translation : classification problem.
* Chatbot : Classification
* Regognization of image: classification
* AlphaGo: Reinforcement
* Auto car : Classification / Reinforcement
* Robotics :

# Regression

Find a linear function h(x) = $\Theta_0 + \Theta_1x_1$
